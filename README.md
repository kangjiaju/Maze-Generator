# Maze-Generator
Maze Generator is Designed for Embodied Intelligent Visual Navigation Tasks

## Project Overview

This project contains a maze generator that creates perfect mazes and corresponding solutions. The generated mazes and solutions are used as training data for robot 2D vision path planning tasks. The dataset provides complex maze environments that help robots improve path planning efficiency and accuracy.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Generates perfect mazes that ensure each maze has a unique solution.
- **Path Solution**: Automatically computes the shortest path from the start to the end for each generated maze.
- **Data Format**: The maze and path data are provided in easily processable formats (e.g., JSON, CSV), making it convenient for machine learning training.
- **Configurability**: Users can set maze size, start and end positions, and other parameters to customize maze generation rules.
